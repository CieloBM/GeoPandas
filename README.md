# Introduction to GeoPandas

http://geopandas.org/

### What is GeoPandas

Briefly, GeoPandas is a Python package that enables geospatial analysis with Pandas dataFrames. It combines the geoprocessing engine of **GDAL** (which is interfaced with the **Fiona** package), the geospatial objects of **Shapely**, and of course the data manipulation power of **Pandas** to enable spatial analysis in Python - no ArcGIS license required!



### Diving in with some example notebooks

In the `notebooks` folder are a set of Jupyter notebooks to familiarize yourself with the objects and functions of the GeoPandas package. While these by no means cover all there is to know about GeoPandas, they do bring you up to speed on some ways to construct a GeoPandas dataFrame and the basic properties and methods of it and other GeoPandas classes.
